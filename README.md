# A web application has been developed to provide essential details about GitHub repositories.

# The application utilizes HTML and CSS for the frontend to create a user-friendly interface, allowing users to input a GitHub username and repository name. The backend, powered by JavaScript, processes the input and fetches the required data from the GitHub API.

# Key information such as the number of stars, contributors, and other relevant repository metrics is extracted and displayed to the user in a clear and concise format.

# This tool serves as a valuable resource for developers and GitHub users seeking quick insights into repository popularity and collaboration.
